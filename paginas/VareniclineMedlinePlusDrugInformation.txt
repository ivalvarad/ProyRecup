Interactions between alcohol and varenicline have resulted in some patients experiencing increased intoxicating effects of alcohol, sometimes associated with aggressive behavior and/or amnesia. In addition, rare accounts of seizures in patients treated with varenicline have been reported. FDA has approved changes to the varenicline label to warn about these risks. Refer to the Drug Safety Communication for a detailed data summary at: http://www.fda.gov/Drugs/DrugSafety/ucm436494.htm .   BACKGROUND: Varenicline is a prescription medicine that is FDA-approved to help adults quit   RECOMMENDATION: Healthcare professionals should weigh the potential risk of seizures against the potential benefits before prescribing varenicline in patients with a history of seizures or other factors that can lower the seizure threshold. Advise patients to immediately stop taking varenicline if they develop agitation, hostility, aggressive behavior, depressed mood, or changes in behavior or thinking that are not typical for them, or if they develop suicidal ideation or  patients know how varenicline affects their ability to tolerate alcohol, they should decrease the amount of alcohol they drink.

However, some of these symptoms occurred in people who were taking varenicline and continued to smoke. Some people had these symptoms when they began taking varenicline, and others developed them after several weeks of treatment or after stopping varenicline. These symptoms have occurred in people without a history of mental illness and have worsened in people who already had a mental illness.
