Meningococcal disease often strikes without warning - even people who are otherwise healthy. Meningococcal disease can spread from person to person through close contact (coughing or kissing) or lengthy contact, especially among people living in the same household. There are at least 12 types of called ''serogroups.'' Serogroups A, B, C, W, and Y cause most meningococcal disease. Anyone can get meningococcal disease but certain people are at increased risk,   less than one year  and young adults 16 through 23 years  with certain medical conditions that affect the immune  who routinely work with isolates of   at risk because of an outbreak in their   when it is treated, meningococcal disease kills 10 to 15 infected people out of 100. And of those who survive, about 10 to 20 out of every 100 will suffer disabilities such as hearing loss, brain damage, amputations, nervous system problems, or severe scars from skin grafts. Meningococcal group B (MenB) vaccine can help prevent meningococcal disease caused by serogroup B.
