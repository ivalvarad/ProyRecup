As a result, recommendations for using entacapone (Comtan) and a combination of entacapone/carbidopa/levodopa (Stalevo) will remain the same in the drug  alerted patients and health care professionals about a possible increased risk for cardiovascular events and death with a combination of entacapone/carbidopa/levodopa in August 2010. This possible safety issue was observed in a clinical trial called the Stalevo Reduction in Dyskinesia Evaluation in Parkinson's Disease (STRIDE-PD) and in a meta-analysis that combined the cardiovascular-related findings from 15 clinical trials comparing a combination of entacapone/carbidopa/levodopa to carbidopa/levodopa. Carbidopa and levodopa have been used extensively and have not been shown to have an increased cardiovascular risk. FDA was concerned that the entacapone in a combination of entacapone/carbidopa/levodopa was responsible for these cardiovascular risks because the comparison drugs do not contain this  better understand the significance of these findings, FDA required the a combination of entacapone/carbidopa/levodopa manufacturer, Novartis, to study the potential for cardiovascular risk with the entacapone component of the drug. FDA examined the results from this required study and from one additional study and concluded they do not show an increased risk of cardiovascular adverse events with entacapone. The results observed in the original meta-analysis were driven by results of a single study (STRIDE-PD), which was not designed to assess cardiovascular risks. FDA believes that the meta-analysis and STRIDE-PD results are chance findings and do not represent a true increase in risk due to   BACKGROUND Entacapone-containing products, Comtan and a combination of entacapone/carbidopa/levodopa, have been shown to be effective in treating symptoms of Parkinson's disease, such as muscle stiffness, tremors, spasms, and poor muscle control. The combination of entacapone with carbidopa and levodopa in entacapone/carbidopa/levodopa has been shown to reduce end-of-dose 'wearing-off' in patients with Parkinson's disease to a greater degree than with entacapone alone or with the two-drug combination of carbidopa and   RECOMMENDATION Healthcare professionals and patients are encouraged to report adverse events or side effects related to the use of these products to the FDA's MedWatch Safety Information and Adverse Event Reporting  more information visit the FDA website at: http://www.fda.gov/Safety/MedWatch/SafetyInformation and http://www.fda.gov/Drugs/DrugSafety .         is this medication                           is an inhibitor of catechol-O-methyltransferase (COMT).
