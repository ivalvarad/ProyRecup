During FDA's review of another potassium-lowering drug, patiromer (Veltassa), we found that patiromer bound to about half of the medications tested, some of which are commonly used in patients who require potassium-lowering drugs. Such binding could decrease the effects of these medications. The label for patiromer contains a warning not to take other orally administered medications within 6 hours of taking  to patiromer, sodium polystyrene sulfonate may also bind to other medications administered by mouth. To reduce this potential risk, prescribers and patients should consider separating sodium polystyrene sulfonate dosing from other medications taken by mouth by at least 6 hours. This includes both prescription medications, such as antibiotics, blood pressure lowering agents and blood thinners, and those purchased over-the-counter without a prescription, such as antacids and laxatives. Health care professionals should monitor blood levels or clinical response to the other medications when  the studies conducted by the sodium polystyrene sulfonate manufacturer, Concordia Pharmaceuticals, confirm significant interactions with other medications, FDA will require all manufacturers of sodium polystyrene sulfonate products to update the drug labels to include information about these drug   BACKGROUND Sodium polystyrene sulfonate (Kayexalate) and generic brands Kionex and SPS are used to treat hyperkalemia, a serious condition in which the amount of potassium in the blood is too high. They work by binding potassium in the large intestine so it can be removed from the   RECOMMENDATION Prescribers and patients should consider separating sodium polystyrene sulfonate dosing from other medications taken by mouth by at least 6 hours. Health care professionals should monitor blood levels or clinical response to the other medications when appropriate. Patients should not stop taking their potassium-lowering drugs without talking to their health care  more information visit the FDA website at: http://www.fda.gov/Safety/MedWatch/SafetyInformation and http://www.fda.gov/Drugs/DrugSafety .         is this medication                           polystyrene sulfonate is used to treat increased amounts of potassium in the         should this medicine be                           polystyrene sulfonate comes as a powder and suspension to take by mouth.
