Notice:                           conjugate vaccine (PCV7) is no longer available in the U.S. Pneumococcal conjugate vaccine (PCV13) will replace this         is pneumococcal                           with bacteria can make children very sick. It causes blood infections, pneumonia, and bacterial meningitis, mostly in young children. (Meningitis is an infection of the covering of the brain.) Pneumococcal meningitis kills about 3 people in 10 who get it. Pneumococcal meningitis can also lead to other health problems, including deafness and brain damage. Before there was a vaccine, pneumococcal infection caused over 700 cases of meningitis, 13,000 blood infections, about 5 million ear infections, and about 200 deaths every year in the United States in children under five. Children younger than 2 years of age are at highest risk for serious disease. Pneumococcal bacteria are spread from person to person through close contact. Pneumococcal infections can be hard to treat because some strains of the bacteria have become resistant to the drugs that have been used to treat them. This makes prevention of pneumococcal infections, through vaccination, even more         get vaccinated with pneumococcal conjugate vaccine                           are 91 strains of pneumococcal bacteria. Pneumococcal conjugate vaccine (PCV) protects against 7 of them. These 7 strains are responsible for most severe pneumococcal infections among children. Since PCV came into use, severe pneumococcal disease has dropped by nearly 80% among children under 5. PCV can also prevent some cases of pneumonia and some ear infections. But pneumonia and ear infections have many causes, and PCV only works against those caused by pneumococcal bacteria. PCV is given to infants and toddlers to protect them when they are at greatest risk for serious diseases caused by pneumococcal bacteria. Older children and adults with certain chronic illnesses may get a different vaccine called pneumococcal polysaccharide vaccine. There is a separate Vaccine Information Statement for that         should get PCV7, and                            and Children Under 2 Years of   is routinely given as a series of 4 doses, one dose at each of these ages: 2 months, 4 months, 6 months, and 12-15 months. Children who miss their shots at these ages should still get the vaccine. The number of doses and the intervals between doses will depend on the child's age. Ask your health care provider for   2 through 4 Years of   children between their 2nd and 5th birthdays who have not completed the PCV series should get 1 dose. Children with medical conditions such as sickle cell disease, a damaged spleen or no spleen, cochlear implants, HIV/AIDS or other diseases that affect the immune system (such as diabetes, cancer, or liver disease), or chronic heart or lung disease or children who take medications that affect the immune system (such as chemotherapy or steroids) should get 1 or 2 doses of PCV, if they have not already completed the 4-dose series.
