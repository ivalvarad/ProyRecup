As a result, FDA is requiring the manufacturer to include information about serious liver injury adverse events to the Contraindications, Warnings and Precautions, Postmarketing Experience, and Hepatic Impairment sections of the ombitasvir/paritaprevir/ritonavir/dasabuvir and ombitasvir/paritaprevir/ritonavir drug  review of adverse events reported to the FDA Adverse Event Reporting System (FAERS) database and to the manufacturer of these medicines, AbbVie, identified cases of hepatic decompensation and liver failure in patients with underlying liver cirrhosis who were taking these medicines. Some of these events resulted in liver transplantation or death. These serious outcomes were reported mostly in patients taking ombitasvir/paritaprevir/ritonavir/dasabuvir who had evidence of advanced cirrhosis even before starting treatment with  the approvals of ombitasvir/paritaprevir/ritonavir/dasabuvir in December 2014 and ombitasvir/paritaprevir/ritonavir in July 2015, at least 26 worldwide cases submitted to FAERS were considered to be possibly or probably related to ombitasvir/paritaprevir/ritonavir/dasabuvir or ombitasvir/paritaprevir/ritonavir. In most of the cases, liver injury occurred within 1 to 4 weeks of starting treatment. Some of the cases occurred in patients for whom these medicines were contraindicated or not recommended. FAERS includes only reports submitted to FDA, so there are likely additional cases about which FDA is   BACKGROUND Ombitasvir/paritaprevir/ritonavir/dasabuvir (Viekira Pak) and ombitasvir/paritaprevir/ritonavir (Technivie) are used to treat chronic hepatitis C. Viekira Pak is a fixed-dose combination of dasabuvir, ombitasvir, paritaprevir, and ritonavir used with or without ribavirin, another hepatitis C medicine. Technivie is a fixed-dose combination of ombitasvir, paritaprevir, and ritonavir, used in combination with   RECOMMENDATION Health care professionals should closely monitor for signs and symptoms of worsening liver disease, such as ascites, hepatic encephalopathy, variceal hemorrhage, and/or increases in direct bilirubin in the  taking these medicines should contact their health care professional immediately if they develop fatigue, weakness, loss of appetite, nausea and vomiting, yellow eyes or skin, or light-colored stools, as these may be signs of liver injury. Patients should not stop taking these medicines without first talking to their health care professionals.

Ombitasvir is a hepatitis C virus (HCV) NS5A inhibitor. It works by stopping the virus that causes hepatitis C from spreading inside the body. Paritaprevir is a protease inhibitor. It works by decreasing the amount of HCV in the body. Ritonavir is a protease inhibitor. It helps to increase the amount of paritaprevir in the body so that the medication will have a greater effect. Dasabuvir is a non-nucleoside NS5B polymerase inhibitor. It works by decreasing the amount of HCV in the body. It is not known if ombitasvir, paritaprevir, ritonavir, or dasabuvir prevent the spread of hepatitis C to other         should this medicine be                           combination of ombitasvir, paritaprevir, ritonavir, and dasabuvir comes as tablets to take by mouth.
