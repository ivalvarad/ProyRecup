Bacteremia kills about one person in five, and meningitis about three people in 10. People with the health problems described below may be more likely to die from the         polysaccharide vaccine                           of pneumococcal infections with penicillin and other drugs used to be more effective. But some strains of the disease have become resistant to these drugs. This makes prevention of the disease, through vaccination, even more important. Pneumococcal polysaccharide vaccine (PPSV) protects against 23 types of pneumococcal bacteria, including those most likely to cause serious disease. Most healthy adults who get the vaccine develop protection to most or all of these types within 2 to 3 weeks of getting the shot. Very old people, children under 2 years of age, and people with some long-term illnesses might not respond as well, or at all. Another type of pneumococcal vaccine (pneumococcal conjugate vaccine, or PCV) is routinely recommended for children younger than 5 years of age.

But these people should still be vaccinated, because they are more likely to have serious complications if they get pneumococcal disease. Children who often get ear infections, sinus infections, or other upper respiratory diseases, but who are otherwise healthy, do not need to get PPSV because it is not effective against those         many doses of PPSV are needed, and                           one dose of PPSV is all that is needed. However, under some circumstances a second dose may be given. A second dose is recommended for people 65 years and older who got their first dose when they were younger than 65 and it has been 5 or more years since the first  second dose is recommended for people 2 through 64 years of age who:    a damaged spleen or no  sickle-cell  HIV infection or  cancer, leukemia, lymphoma, multiple  nephrotic  had an organ or bone marrow  taking medication that lowers immunity (such as chemotherapy or long-term   a second dose is given, it should be given 5 years after the first         people should not get PPSV or should                            who has had a life-threatening allergic reaction to PPSV should not get another  who has a severe allergy to any component of a vaccine should not get that vaccine.
