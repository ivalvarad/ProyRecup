The new study included information from more than 134,000 Medicare patients, 65 years or older, and found that among new users of blood-thinning drugs, dabigatran was associated with a lower risk of clot-related strokes, bleeding in the brain, and death, than warfarin. The study also found an increased risk of major gastrointestinal bleeding with use of dabigatran as compared to warfarin. The MI risk was similar for the two  the new study is based on a much larger and older patient population than those used in FDA's earlier review of post-market data, and employed a more sophisticated analytical method to capture and analyze the events of concern. This study's findings, except with regard to MI, are consistent with the clinical trial results that provided the basis for dabigatran's approval. As a result of these latest findings, the FDA still considers dabigatran to have a favorable benefit to risk profile and have made no changes to the current label or recommendations for   BACKGROUND: Dabigatran and warfarin are used to reduce the risk of stroke and blood clots in patients with a common type of abnormal heart rhythm called non-valvular atrial fibrillation   RECOMMENDATION: Patients should not stop taking dabigatran (or warfarin) without first talking with their health care professionals. Stopping the use of blood-thinning medications such as dabigatran and warfarin can increase the risk of stroke and lead to permanent disability and death.
